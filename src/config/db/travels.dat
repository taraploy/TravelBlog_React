In fact, Indonesia is one of the most popular destinations in Asia.

We’ll talk about travel facts, the best time to visit Indonesia, the best destinations, recommended itineraries, travel costs, travel essentials and how to prepare for your trip.","language":"Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)","currency":"IDR (Indonesian rupiah)","food":"When it comes to food, you can find different types of restaurants. If you eat local food, you can eat for less than IDR 3000. Obviously, you may find elegant restaurants around the country when you can pay more if you wish to. The cheapest options are usually in small local restaurants called warungs.","activities":"Some activities such as hiking or beach bumming are free. Although, if you’re planning on visiting temples, doing yoga retreats, getting surfing lessons or going on a diving trip, you will have to pay for it.","transportation":"In general, it’s pretty easy to get around Indonesia. You can either fly, take a ferry, a bus or hire a private driver to reach your destinations.\n\nTo book your transport between destinations, you can book via 12GO or via a travel agency. Most of the time, your hotel and hostel may be able to help you.","safety":"Overall, traveling around Indonesia is fairly safe. Of course, you should always lock your valuables especially if you’re staying in a hostel. \n\nATM and card skimming are pretty common and you should try and only use ATMs attached to banks. You can pick an ATM with cameras too. Skimming is popular around the Gili Islands and Nusa Islands, where there are only a few ATMs available. Having a travel card such as Revolut allows you to freeze your bank account, which is great for traveling around Indonesia. In Java and Lombok, the culture is a little different (if we compare to Bali) and rip-offs tend to happen more often. Be prepared to negotiate more.\n\nWhen driving around, you should always put your purse and valuables inside your motorbike because people could try to snatch them. Pickpocketing is also common so make sure to keep your valuables in a safe spot especially if you’re going out –  it happens a lot on dance floors. That said, if you have a safe in your hotel, use it to keep your money safe.\n\nFor ladies: it’s not always safe to walk alone at night. Groping can happen and it’s always smart to ask a friend to walk you home at night. The same applies for driving at night time. Avoid dark alleys if you can and read the updates in the Expats groups on Facebook. Ususally, you can find information on dangerous spots within the female groups.\n\nBe prepared that you might get into dodgy situations if you have to deal with the police. If you’re stopped by the police, remember your rights. You should always get your fine in paper and not pay the police straight away with cash since bribing and corruption is “popular” in Indonesia. You ask for a “blue fine”.","visa":"Depending on your nationality, you may need to get a visa to visit Indonesia. Note that many countries receive a free entry up to 30 days. Then, you may be able to extend your visa for an extra 30 days.\n\nIf you wish to extend your visa – you will need to go to the visa on arrival at the airport. You’ll have to pay a fee and then you’ll have to go the Immigration office three times. You can also get an agent and this way, you can go to the Immigration only once.","accommodation":"In Indonesia, you’ll find several options when it comes to accommodation.

Always remember to keep your valuables off-sight in crowded places. You can avoid the most common scams by doing your research, and knowing how much basic things, like taxi rides, should cost.
